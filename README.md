# Vimhelp
A bash script that prints a vim commands cheatsheet for my convenience...

Based on Vim Cheat Sheet https://vim.rtorr.com    

I like VIM but I do not use it enough or so often that I can recall its useful commands. Therefore I decided to make a simple bash script that would give me the convenience of seeing a vim cheatsheet through command line.

Installation (Mac OS):
+ place the vimhelp.sh somewhere convenient (eg.. Documents)
+ vim ~/.bash_profile
  + add this line ```alias vimhelp="sh /Users/<your name>/Documents/vimhelp.sh"```
+ save the file

Usage:
+ Open terminal
+ type vimhelp
